## Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end data science pipeline to analyze and predict **customer churn** in a telecom company. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service so businesses can take proactive retention actions.

The project demonstrates a complete analytics workflow combining **SQL for data cleaning, Power BI for business insights, and machine learning in Python for predictive modeling.**

## Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
* **SQL**
* **Power BI**

---

## Machine Learning Model

The project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict whether a customer will churn.

To improve model performance, **GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation** was used for hyperparameter tuning. The following parameters were optimized:

* `n_estimators` – number of trees in the forest
* `max_depth` – maximum depth of decision trees
* `min_samples_split` – minimum samples required to split a node
* `max_features` – number of features considered at each split

This approach helps select the **best-performing model configuration**.

---

## Model Evaluation

The model performance was evaluated using multiple metrics:

* **Accuracy:** ~86%
* **Confusion Matrix**
* **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
* **ROC-AUC Score**
* **ROC Curve**

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model’s classification performance.

## Feature Importance Insights

Feature importance analysis shows that the most influential factors for churn prediction include:

* **Tenure in Months**
* **Contract Type**
* **Monthly Charges**
* **Total Revenue**
* **Customer Usage Patterns**

Customers with **short tenure and month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn.

## Churn Prediction for New Customers

The trained model was used to predict churn probabilities for new customers.

Customers with churn probability **greater than 0.8** were classified as high-risk churn customers.

The predictions were exported to an Excel file for further business analysis.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides business insights including:

* Customer churn distribution
* Contract type analysis
* Revenue trends
* Customer behavior patterns
